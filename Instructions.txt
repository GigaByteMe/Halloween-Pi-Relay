This project relies on knowledge of Raspberry Pi, Python and Basic Electricty.  It is the last part 
that all precautions must be taken.  If you do not have experience with electricty do not attempt this project.

My background:  I am a computer programmer and have been writing code in one way or another since I was a kid...
(I was born in 1970!)....  I have a basic understanding of home electricity and have installed outlets, lights, switches, 
etc in my home many times.  I have a background in EET (Electical Engineering Technology) and took various EE classes 
at Purdue University.  So I have been making LEDs light up using a bread board and circuit gates since the 90s.  I don't 
feel that you need ALL of this knowledge in order to complete this project, however, an understanding of these things
is a plus and again.... if you don't feel comfortable with Electirciy, don't attempt this project.

Parts needed: 
1.) A working Raspberry Pi loaded with Raspbian and running or able to run at least python 2.7 which 
is what I wrote this on so I know it works with that version.  
2.) A PIR Sensor  - I used this but was able to only buy 1 , not the 3 pack:

3.) Pi Relay HAT - I used this one and liked that the pins were still available to be used on top
    And the fact that it was capable of taking 15 Amps at 120 V DC

4.) Something to turn off or on (I chose a strobe light for Halloween)
5.) An External speaker - I just used one that I knew had a mini (headphone jack) type wire
so that I could plug it into my raspberry pi
6.) An old extension chord is best - This is what is needed to wire into the relay
and requires knowledge of 120 V AC electricty such as what is found in the common US Home.

Put everything together.... Google it ....  Most of this can be found very easily online, just 
make sure to not use the same pins that the relay is using for the PIR sensor.  
I used BCM Pin mapping and PIN 23 for my PIR Sensor, and the relay comes pre-configured on BCM PINs
26, 21 and 20.  for my project I am only using one relay the one configured on PIN 21.

Then I cut an old extension chord.  I decided to put a shorter end with the plug as the input to the board
(raspberry pi) becuase it would also require a power chord, and left a bit longer end as the other side, so 
that I could put the scary light someplace a little farter away.  You could however make them both shorter and
use extensions chords on both ends as needed... just decide what you think will be best for your project.  

A quick overview of relays:
You can wire a relay in one of two ways.  Normally Open - N/O or Normally Closed - N/C
Normally Open means that when the relay is in passive (not activated) mode - the circuit will be open, meaning
power will not be able to pass through the relay while the circuit is open.
Vise versa if you wire in Normally Closed in passive mode the circuit will be closed.  Meaning power will be running 
through the relay.
I just picked N/O - but if you look at the notes in my codes, when I rewire this someday, I would switch this to N/C.

so, I took the 'hot' wire - (Black) from the male end and wired it into one side of my N/O Relay circuit.  
I took the other Hot (black) from the female end, and wired it into the other side of my N/O relay circuit.  Then I 
tied the two neutrals (white) and grounds (green or bare copper) together to each other,... white to white and 
ground to ground.    If you were able to fit it in, you could theoratically NOT CUT the neutral or ground wires
on your extension chord.  

Once the relay is wired and the code is built, I plugged everything in and waited for sparks or smoking wires
Not seeing either one I proceeded to login to the pi and run the halloween2020.py code, testin the PIR sensor.  
I find the sensor is very good, and therefore pretty sensitive, so I built a little cardboard cutout to create a smaller
"kill zone".  By narrowing the field the PIR sensor can see.  

Turn it on and have fun scarring little kids that come by the house for Halloween.
